**[walk towards the rifle]**

**[enter the store]**

## [Walk towrads the rifle]

You walk over to the rifle and it only has on shot left.  You wonder if you can find more bullets and possibly anything edible but instead come across some humans that don't look normal and are acting terrifying.

**[try to get passed the monster humans unnoticed]**

**[grab every object you can and get ready to fight them]**

---
## [Enter the store]
You enter the ransacked store, stepping over a variety of broken goods and produce. The smell of all the smashed produce together is horrendous but as you make it toward the back of the store, there is a door leading to some sort of employee area. Wafting from the area is the smell of bacon. Do you:

**[enter the employee room and investigate the smell of this bacon]**

**[opt for some other food]**

## [Try to get passed the monster humans unnoticed]
You try to sneak pass the monster humans unnoticed. As they approach near to your area, you hide somewhere near by. Suddenly a hand grabs your shoulder, you turn around ready to shoot but notice it's another person. "Follow me" he says

**[follow the stranger]**

**[ignore him]**

---

## [grab every object you can and get ready to fight them]
luckily there is a baseball bat lying beside the overturned car in the middle of the road. you rush over to grab the weapon, but doing so you kick a glass bottle which attracted more human monsters. 

**[stay and fight]**

**[take the bat and run]**

---

## [Stay and Fight]
you pick up the bat and get a firm grip. the monster humans are closing in from every direction. you swing at one in the head with all you force and killed it. you begin to to climb the overturnned car and defend yourself. you are outnumbered as they begin to scale the car. the monster humans surround you and tear you apart.
## [take the bat and run]
You know you are outnumbered and the bat won't be enough to fight back but you take it anyway and look for the safest spot to lay low.  Suddenly you find a car that damaged but working with the keys inside.

**[jump in the car and drive wherever]**

**[stay on feet to be more discrete]**

## [stay on feet to be more discrete]
While the car does seem safe you don't know what else is out there nor how long the car will last.  You choose to keep on your feet to not draw attention and keep collecting random items.  Then you come across 
wild zebras that escaped the zoo.

**[take one down to eat]**

**[ignore them and keep moving]**
