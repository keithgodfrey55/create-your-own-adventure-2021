**[enter the store]**

## [Walk towards the rifle]

You walk over to the rifle and it only has on shot left. You wonder if you can find more bullets and possibly anything edible but instead come across some humans that don't look normal and are acting terrifying.

**[try to get passed the monster humans unnoticed]**

**[grab every object you can and get ready to fight them]**

## [Enter the store]

You enter the ransacked store, stepping over a variety of broken goods and produce. The smell of all the smashed produce together is horrendous but as you make it toward the back of the store, there is a door leading to some sort of employee area. Wafting from the area is the smell of bacon. Do you:

**[enter the employee room and investigate the smell of this bacon]**

**[opt for some other food]**

## [Try to get passed the monster humans unnoticed]

**[follow the stranger]**

**[ignore him]**

---

## [grab every object you can and get ready to fight them]

luckily there is a baseball bat lying beside the overturned car in the middle of the road. you rush over to grab the weapon, but doing so you kick a glass bottle which attracted more human monsters.

**[stay and fight]**

**[take the bat and run]**

## [Stay and Fight]

you pick up the bat and get a firm grip. the monster humans are closing in from every direction. you swing at one in the head with all you force and killed it. you begin to to climb the overturnned car and defend yourself. you are outnumbered as they begin to scale the car. the monster humans surround you and tear you apart.

## [take the bat and run]

You know you are outnumbered and the bat won't be enough to fight back but you take it anyway and look for the safest spot to lay low. Suddenly you find a car that damaged but working with the keys inside.

**[jump in the car and drive wherever]**

**[stay on feet to be more discrete]**

---

## [jump in car and drive wherever]

You drive for several miles, finally feeling some semblance of safety as the human monsters disappear into the rearview, but now you start lookin toward next steps. What do I need to do to survive? Do you:

**[find a safe place to stay]**

**[try and find other people]**

---

## [stay on feet to be more discrete]

While the car does seem safe you don't know what else is out there nor how long the car will last. You choose to keep on your feet to not draw attention and keep collecting random items. Then you come across
wild zebras that escaped the zoo.

**[take one down to eat]**

**[ignore them and keep moving]**

## [Enter the employee room and investigate the smell of bacon]

You enter the store and find fresh bacon that looks professionally made and wonder where it came from. You find traces of soda cans and suddenly you hear the toilet flush in the store bathroom. Out comes a woman who is physically fit and looks like she can fight.

**[introduce yourself and offer to team up with her]**

**[keep to yourself because you think she will see you as a drawback]**

---

## [take one down to eat]

You've never taken down a zebra, but hunger doesn't discriminate. Your only weapon is the bat but you can make it work. After you take the zebra down, you use a lighter you collected to start a fire and cook some of the meat. Then you notice it's getting dark. Do you:

**[find a place to sleep where you are]**

## [Find a safe place to stay]

Your safety comes first and for most. So the best option for now was to find a safe place to stay. You drive a few more miles until you find a rundown factory. You decide to check out the place for any materials you can use. Then you hear a scream coming from the building.

**[check out where the scream is coming from]**

**[turn around and run]**

---

## [opt for some other food]

You walk around the store and collect some food items that you think will last. Some beef jerky, cereal, power bars, and some water. Fully kitted now and hunger sated, you leave the store. Down the street, you see the a horde of monster humans attacking another person. Armed with nothing, do you:

**[risk your life and try to save them]**
**[cut your losses and move on]**

## [Ignore Them and Keep moving]

You don't have time to play with any animals right now. So you ignore them and keep moving. Suddenly the noise from the animals caused the monsters to run in your direction.

**[Do you finally stay and fight]**

**[Try to hide among the zebras]**
